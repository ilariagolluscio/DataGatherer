# DataGatherer

This project is aimed at the creation of a software that allows for sem i-automatic extraction of specific data from a given set of images.


## Precautions

This code is made to be run **locally**. It does not manage access to data, nor protects from unauthorized access. 
Please, double check that port 8080 is not reachable from outside your trusted network.


## Testing Coverage

The front end (React) is not automatically tested. 

The back end (Django) is unit tested.
Automatic testing is performed on all critical operations involving data. 
The generated matrix is tested to be accurate to the data registered in the DB.


## Requirements

You need Docker installed.

## Result

You will be able to get a matrix:

|           | user_1    | user_2 | ... | user_3    |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|-----------|
| hashtag_1 | weight_11 |        |     |           |
| hashtag_2 |           |        |     |           |
| hashtag_n |           |        |     | weight_nn |

where weight = in how many posts a user has used the hashtag?
